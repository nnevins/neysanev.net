# A Prayer for Scientists

*Baruch Ata Adonai, Eloheinu Chei Haolamim, Pokeach Ivrim*
Blessed are you, Our God, Life of all the Worlds, who opens the eyes of the blind.

Creator of the Universe, You have blessed humankind with seemingly infinite wonders to explore.
You have blessed us with raw materials from which to create tools and shelter. You have granted
me the privilege to be a scientist, to discover the wonders of Your creations.
Thank You for opening my eyes and giving me the wisdom, creativity, and vision to see beyond
myself and beyond the current understanding of how the world works.
Thank You for the opportunity to live in a time and place where I will not be condemned for
suggesting new models and theories.

May I be open to the ideas of my teachers and colleagues and may I be ready to share and
communicate my own ideas in a spirit of working together towards greater understanding. May I be
blessed with patience and inspiration. May my mind remain clear and alert for many years to come.
May my work of discovery be in service of You, Our God, and may I not confuse theories with the
deeper Truth of the Oneness of all life. May I be ever aware of the political influences on and
implications of my discoveries. May my contributions ultimately be for the greater good of the
world in which we live.

May I continually discern Your presence in my work as scientist.
